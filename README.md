## About the project
In order to help the Metropolitan Police allocate forces more effectively in the borough of Barnet in London to minimize the number of burglaries that happen, we developed two models; one predicted the number of crimes that would happen in the LSOA areas of Barnet in the next 12 months (Prophet model) and a second one which predicted the most likely LSOA areas to suffer a burglary in the forthcoming year (Forecaster with XGBoost model).
